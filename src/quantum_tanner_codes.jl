Generate a pair of symmetric generating sets for group G of sizes δ_A and δ_B.

Returns a pair of symmetric generating sets (A, B) that generate G and satisfy the non-conjugacy condition.

Both A and B are symmetric (closed under inversion), the union A ∪ B generates G, A and B are disjoint,
and the pair (A, B) satisfies the total non-conjugacy condition: for all a ∈ A, b ∈ B, g ∈ G, a ≠ gbg⁻¹.

# Left-Right Cayley Complex

A Cayley graph `\\Gamma(V,E)`` provides a graph-theoretic representation
of a group G via a fixed generating set S that excludes the identity element.
The vertex set V corresponds to elements of G, with an edge connecting vertices
g and g' if and only if there exists ``s \\in S`` such that `g \\cdot s = g'``,
where ``\\cdot`` denotes the group operation. Edges are undirected if S is symmetric,
i.e., ``S = S^{-1}``.

A left-right Cayley complex extends this construction by incorporating both left
and right group actions. Specifically, we consider two symmetric generating sets A
and B and define a *bipartite* structure on the vertices.

Consider G be a finite group with symmetric generating sets ``A, B \\subseteq G``
such that ``\\langle A, B \\rangle = G`` and ``A = A^{-1}``, ``B = B^{-1}``. The
left-right Cayley complex ``\\Gamma(G,A,B)`` is defined as:

- Vertex set: ``V = V_0 \\cup V_1 = \\{g_i \\mid g \\in G, i \\in \\{0,1\\}\\}``
- Edge sets:
   - E_A = \\{(g_i, (ag)_j) \\mid a \\in A, g \\in G, i \\neq j\\}
   - E_B = \\{(g_i, (gb)_j) \\mid b \\in B, g \\in G, i \\neq j\\}

This construction yields a 2-dimensional complex whose faces are 4-cycles of the form:

```math
\\begin{aligned}
\\{g_i, (ag)_j, (gb)_j, (agb)_i \\mid i,j \\in \\{0,1\\}, i \\neq j\\}
\\end{aligned}
```

To ensure distinct opposite vertices in each face, we require that elements of A and B are not conjugates:

```math
\\begin{aligned}
\\forall a \\in A, b \\in B, g \\in G, \\quad ag \\neq gb
\\end{aligned}
```

Satisfying *Total Non-Conjugacy (TNC)* guarantees a proper 2D complex structure
where each vertex has degree ``\\Delta_A + \\Delta_B``, with ``\\Delta_A = |A|``
and ``\\Delta_B = |B|``. We typically take ``\\Delta_A = \\Delta_B = \\Delta`` [radebold2025explicit](@cite).

# Tensor codes

Classical linear block codes employ redundancy to encode information and
detect/correct errors. An `[n,k]`-code encodes k information bits into `n > k`
bits, described by either:
- A ``k \\times n`` generator matrix G whose rows span the code space
- An ``(n-k) \\times n`` parity check matrix H representing parity constraints

These satisfy ``GH^T = 0``.

For quantum Tanner codes, [radebold2025explicit](@cite) utilize a pair of binary
linear codes ``(C_A, C_B)`` where:
- ``C_A`` encodes ``\\rho\\Delta_A`` bits into ``\\Delta_A`` bits (``0 < \\rho < 1``)
- ``C_B`` encodes ``(1-\\rho)\\Delta_B`` bits into ``\\Delta_B`` bits

We construct tensor codes:

```math
\\begin{aligned}
C_0 = C_A \\otimes C_B, \\quad C_1 = C_A^\\perp \\otimes C_B^\\perp
\\end{aligned}
```

where ``\\dim(C_i \\otimes C_j) = \\dim(C_i)\\dim(C_j)`` and ``d(C_i \\otimes C_j) = d(C_i)d(C_j)``
for minimum distances.

# Quantum Tanner codes

To construct a quantum Tanner code, we begin with a left-right Cayley complex
``\\Gamma(G,A,B)`` built from a finite non-abelian group ``G``. Let ``Q`` denote
the complete set of faces of the complex, and for each vertex ``v \\in V``, let ``Q(v)``
be the set of faces incident to ``v`` [radebold2025explicit](@cite). We note that ``Q(v)``
is uniquely determined by pairs ``(a,b) \\in A \\times B`` for every vertex ``v``. The
physical qubits of the quantum code are placed on the faces of the complex, so the code
length is ``n = |Q|``.

We select two classical binary linear codes ``C_A`` and ``C_B``, where ``C_A``
encodes ``\\rho\\Delta_A`` logical bits into ``\\Delta_A`` bits for some
``0 < \\rho < 1``, and ``C_B`` encodes ``(1-\\rho)\\Delta_B`` logical bits into
``\\Delta_B`` bits. From these, we form the tensor codes ``C_0 = C_A \\otimes C_B``
and ``C_1 = C_A^\\perp \\otimes C_B^\\perp``. Since the number of columns of ``C_A`` is
``\\Delta_A``, we can label these columns with elements of ``A``. Having fixed this
association, we use the notation that codewords of ``C_A`` are binary vectors ``\\beta_A \\in \\mathbb{F}_2^A``.
Similarly, we associate the columns of ``C_B`` with elements of ``B``, so that
codewords of ``C_B`` are binary vectors ``\\beta_B \\subset \\mathbb{F}_2^B``. This
correspondence between the bits of the classical codes and group elements yields a natural
labeling of the columns of the tensor codes ``C_0`` and ``C_1`` by pairs ``(a,b) \\in A \\times B``
[radebold2025explicit](@cite).

To construct stabilizer generators on ``\\Gamma(G,A,B)`` using the classical codes
``C_0`` and ``C_1``, [radebold2025explicit](@cite)
define a function

```math
\\begin{aligned}
\\phi_v: A \\times B \\to Q(v)
\\end{aligned}
```

for each vertex v by ``\\phi_v(a,b) = {v, av, vb, avb}``, which maps a pair of
group generators to the unique face in ``Q(v)`` that it defines. One can verify that
``\\phi_v`` is bijective [radebold2025explicit](@cite). For each basis element
``\\beta`` of ``C_0``, we associate a set of pairs of group generators

```math
\\begin{aligned}
Z(\\beta) = \\{(a,b) \\mid \\beta_{(a,b)} = 1\\}
\\end{aligned}
```

corresponding to the nonzero entries of ``\\beta``. Each Z-stabilizer generator
of the quantum Tanner code is then specified by a choice of vertex ``v \\in V_0``
and classical codeword ``\\beta`` such that the ``Z``-stabilizer generator has
support equal to the set of faces ``\\phi_v(Z(\\beta))``. We can characterize this
stabilizer generator by a binary vector ``x \\in \\mathbb{F}2^Q``, where the |Q| qubits
are labelled by faces of the complex. For a given Z-stabilizer generator, the restriction
``x|{Q(v)}`` equals a basis element ``\\beta`` of ``C_0`` (based on a fixed ordering of
the faces), and is zero elsewhere. This yields ``\\dim(C_0)|V_0|`` Z-type stabilizer
generators, which correspond to codewords of C_0 placed locally at each vertex [radebold2025explicit](@cite).

[radebold2025explicit](@cite) repeat the same process for vertices ``v \\in V_1`` and
basis elements of ``C_1`` to produce ``\\dim(C_1)|V_1|`` X-type stabilizers at each vertex of that partition.

!!! note
    We note that there exist alternative formulations of quantum Tanner codes
    in the literature. The construction presented in [radebold2025explicit](@cite)
    utilizes the left-right Cayley complex structure where qubits are placed on the
    square faces (the 4-cycles of the form ``\\{g, ag, gb, agb\\}``) and stabilizers
    are defined via local tensor codes at vertices. In contrast, other approaches such
    as [gu2022efficient](@cite) employ a multigraph construction where qubits are
    identified with edges of the multigraphs ``\\mathcal{G}_0^\\square`` and ``\\mathcal{G}_1^\\square``
    derived from the left-right Cayley complex. These multigraphs have vertex set
    ``V_0 = G \\times \\{0\\}`` (respectively ``V_1 = G \\times \\{1\\}``). Edges correspond
    to squares ``q \\in Q`` connecting vertices ``(g,0)`` and ``(agb,0)`` via the relation
    ``g' = agb``. Stabilizers are built from Tanner codes associated with these multigraphs.

# Stabilizer Matrices

For each vertex v ∈ V₀ and basis element β ∈ C₀, we define the support set [radebold2025explicit](@cite): Z(β) = {(a,b) ∈ A×B | β_(a,b) = 1}

The corresponding Z-stabilizer generator has support φ_v(Z(β)), where φ_v: A×B → Q(v) is the bijective mapping
from generator pairs to incident faces [radebold2025explicit](@cite).

Similarly, for each vertex v ∈ V₁ and basis element β ∈ C₁, we define X-stabilizer generators
with support φ_v(Z(β)) [radebold2025explicit](@cite).

This yields dim(C₀) × |V₀| Z-type stabilizer generators and dim(C₁) × |V₁| X-type stabilizer generators

The resulting quantum code exhibits the Low-Density Parity-Check because each stabilizer generator
acts on at most Δ² qubits (where Δ = |A| = |B|) and each qubit is involved in at most 4ρ(1-ρ)Δ² stabilizer
generators. These bounds remain constant as |G| → ∞, ensuring the LDPC property [radebold2025explicit](@cite). 

# CSS Commutativity

All stabilizer generators of opposite type commute pairwise. The CSS orthogonality constraint 
C_X ⊂ C_Z^⊥ is fulfilled because when a C₀-generator (from V₀) and C₁-generator (from V₁)
have intersecting supports, their anchor vertices must be neighbors in the bipartite graph. If
connected by a B-edge, their local views share an A-set where C_A ⟂ C_A^⊥ ensures orthogonality. Note that
he A-edge case is analogous with C_B ⟂ C_B^⊥

# Quantum Tanner code parameters

For component codes C_A[Δ, ρΔ, δΔ] and C_B[Δ, (1-ρ)Δ, δΔ], the number of physical qubits is n = Δ²|G|/2, number of X-stabs is
dim(C₁) × |V₁| ≈ 2ρ(1-ρ)Δ²|G| and number of Z-stabs is dim(C₀) × |V₀| ≈ 2ρ(1-ρ)Δ²|G|. The resulting quantum code rate is
≥ (2ρ - 1)². For other properties, see [radebold2025explicit](@cite).

# Dihedral Ramanujan Graphs

The quantum Tanner code construction of [radebold2025explicit](@cite) utilizes a specific class
of *[Frobenius groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frobenius_group)*.

A finite group G is a Frobenius group if it can be expressed as a [semidirect product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semidirect_product)

```math
\\begin{aligned}
G = N \\rtimes H
\\end{aligned}
```

where N (the *Frobenius kernel*) and H (the *Frobenius complement*) satisfy the condition that the
ratio ``r = \\frac{|N|-1}{|H|}`` is a positive integer. A canonical example, and the one primarily
utilized in ([radebold2025explicit](@cite), [hirano2016ramanujan](@cite)), is the *dihedral group*
of order 2p for an odd prime p:

```math
\\begin{aligned} 
D_{2p} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^p = y^2 = 1, yxy^{-1} = x^{-1} \\rangle.
\\end{aligned}
```

For ``D_{2p}``, the kernel is the cyclic subgroup ``N = \\langle x \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_p`` and the
complement is ``H = \\langle y \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2``, yielding ``r = \\frac{p-1}{2}``.

[hirano2016ramanujan](@cite) provides a method to construct Ramanujan graphs from these groups. A Cayley
graph ``\\text{Cay}(G, S)`` is **Ramanujan** if its non-trivial eigenvalues ``\\lambda`` satisfy
``|\\lambda| \\leq 2\\sqrt{|S|-1}``. For a Frobenius group ``G = N \\rtimes H`` with ``r \\geq 4``,
the Theorem 3.3 of [hirano2016ramanujan](@cite) states that the maximum "covalency" ``\\hat{l}_{G, \\mathcal{S}_0}``
for which all corresponding normal Cayley graphs remain Ramanujan is given by the trivial bound:

```math
\\begin{aligned} 
\\hat{l}_{G, \\mathcal{S}_0} = l_0 = \\max \\{ l \\in \\mathcal{L} \\mid l \\le 2(\\sqrt{|G|}-1) \\}.
\\end{aligned}
```

For the dihedral group ``D_{2p}`` with ``p \\geq 11``, this bound specializes to Corollary 3.4 of [hirano2016ramanujan](@cite):

```math
\\begin{aligned} 
\\hat{l} = 2 \\left\\lfloor \\sqrt{2p} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right\\rfloor - 1.
\\end{aligned}
```

Thus, [radebold2025explicit](@cite) uses such dihedral groups  ``\\D_{2p}`` and their symmetric generating
sets to construct the underlying expander graphs for the quantum Tanner code.

!!! note
    This is a newer version of the less well designed function `[`gen_code`](@ref)(G, A, B, bipartite=true, use_same_local_code=false)`.
    It constructs the quantum Tanner code given a finite group G equipped with two *symmetric* generating sets A and B,
    alongside pairs of classical codes — comprising parity check and generator matrices — that are utilized in the
    construction of classical Tanner codes. To illustrate its application, the implementation can employ generating
    sets computed from the Morgenstern's explicit construction of Ramanujan graphs for odd prime power `q` generating sets.

Here is an example of a new `[[360, 8, 10]]` quantum Tanner code using Morgenstern generating sets

Enumerate all square incidences in the Left-Right Cayley Complex
following introduction by [dinur2022locally](@cite).

The Left-Right Cayley Complex X is an [incidence structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_structure)
between:
- Vertices V = V₀ ∪ V₁ where V₀ = G×{0}, V₁ = G×{1}
- A-edges E_A = {(g,0), (ag,1)} for g ∈ G, a ∈ A ([double cover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_double_cover) of left Cayley graph Cay(G,A))
- B-edges E_B = {(g,0), (gb,1)} for g ∈ G, b ∈ B ([double cover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_double_cover) of right Cayley graph Cay(G,B))
- Squares Q = {(g,0), (ag,1), (gb,1), (agb,0)} for g ∈ G, a ∈ A, b ∈ B

Each square q ∈ Q corresponds to one physical qubit in the quantum Tanner code. Each square appears in two
natural local views [radebold2025explicit](@cite):
- From V₀ vertices: defines the graph Γ₀^□ = (V₀, Q) used for Z-stabilizers
- From V₁ vertices: defines the graph Γ₁^□ = (V₁, Q) used for X-stabilizers

We explicitly enumerates both incidences of each square to facilitate the Tanner code construction.

# Construction Framework

For each vertex v ∈ V, the set of incident faces Q(v) is uniquely determined by pairs (a,b) ∈ A×B.

The bijective mapping φ_v: A×B → Q(v) is defined as [radebold2025explicit](@cite): φ_v(a,b) = {v, av, vb, avb}

This establishes a natural labeling of qubits (*faces*) by generator pairs, allowing classical tensor codes
to be applied locally at each vertex [radebold2025explicit](@cite).

### Arguments
- `G`: A finite group
- `A`: Symmetric generating set (closed under inverses) not containing the identity
