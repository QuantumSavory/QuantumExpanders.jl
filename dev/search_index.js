The vertex set V corresponds to elements of G, with an edge connecting vertices g and g' if and only if there existss \\in Ssuch thatg \\cdot s = g' where\\cdotdenotes the group operation Edges are undirected if S is symmetric ieS = S^{-1}``.\n\nA left-right Cayley complex extends this construction by incorporating both left and right group actions. Specifically, we consider two symmetric generating sets A and B and define a bipartite structure on the vertices.\n\nConsider G be a finite group with symmetric generating sets A B subseteq G such that langle A B rangle = G and A = A^-1, B = B^-1. The left-right Cayley complex Gamma(GAB) is defined as:\n\nVertex set: V = V_0 cup V_1 = g_i mid g in G i in 01\nEdge sets:\nEA = {(gi, (ag)_j) \\mid a \\in A, g \\in G, i \\neq j}\nEB = {(gi, (gb)_j) \\mid b \\in B, g \\in G, i \\neq j}\n\nThis construction yields a 2-dimensional complex whose faces are 4-cycles of the form:\n\nbeginaligned\ng_i (ag)_j (gb)_j (agb)_i mid ij in 01 i neq j\nendaligned\n\nTo ensure distinct opposite vertices in each face, we require that elements of A and B are not conjugates:\n\nbeginaligned\nforall a in A b in B g in G quad ag neq gb\nendaligned\n\nSatisfying Total Non-Conjugacy (TNC) guarantees a proper 2D complex structure where each vertex has degree Delta_A + Delta_B, with Delta_A = A and Delta_B = B. We typically take Delta_A = Delta_B = Delta (Radebold et al., 2025).\n\nTensor codes\n\nClassical linear block codes employ redundancy to encode information and detect/correct errors. An [n,k]-code encodes k information bits into n > k bits, described by either:\n\nA k times n generator matrix G whose rows span the code space\nAn (n-k) times n parity check matrix H representing parity constraints\n\nThese satisfy GH^T = 0.\n\nFor quantum Tanner codes, (Radebold et al., 2025) utilize a pair of binary linear codes (C_A C_B) where:\n\nC_A encodes rhoDelta_A bits into Delta_A bits (0  rho  1)\nC_B encodes (1-rho)Delta_B bits into Delta_B bits\n\nWe construct tensor codes:\n\nbeginaligned\nC_0 = C_A otimes C_B quad C_1 = C_A^perp otimes C_B^perp\nendaligned\n\nwhere dim(C_i otimes C_j) = dim(C_i)dim(C_j) and d(C_i otimes C_j) = d(C_i)d(C_j) for minimum distances.\n\nQuantum Tanner codes\n\nTo construct a quantum Tanner code, we begin with a left-right Cayley complex Gamma(GAB) built from a finite non-abelian group G. Let Q denote the complete set of faces of the complex, and for each vertex v in V, let Q(v) be the set of faces incident to v (Radebold et al., 2025). We note that Q(v) is uniquely determined by pairs (ab) in A times B for every vertex v. The physical qubits of the quantum code are placed on the faces of the complex, so the code length is n = Q.\n\nWe select two classical binary linear codes C_A and C_B, where C_A encodes rhoDelta_A logical bits into Delta_A bits for some 0  rho  1, and C_B encodes (1-rho)Delta_B logical bits into Delta_B bits. From these, we form the tensor codes C_0 = C_A otimes C_B and C_1 = C_A^perp otimes C_B^perp. Since the number of columns of C_A is Delta_A, we can label these columns with elements of A. Having fixed this association, we use the notation that codewords of C_A are binary vectors beta_A in mathbbF_2^A. Similarly, we associate the columns of C_B with elements of B, so that codewords of C_B are binary vectors beta_B subset mathbbF_2^B. This correspondence between the bits of the classical codes and group elements yields a natural labeling of the columns of the tensor codes C_0 and C_1 by pairs (ab) in A times B (Radebold et al., 2025).\n\nTo construct stabilizer generators on Gamma(GAB) using the classical codes C_0 and C_1, (Radebold et al., 2025) define a function\n\nbeginaligned\nphi_v A times B to Q(v)\nendaligned\n\nfor each vertex v by phi_v(ab) = v av vb avb, which maps a pair of group generators to the unique face in Q(v) that it defines. One can verify that phi_v is bijective (Radebold et al., 2025). For each basis element beta of C_0, we associate a set of pairs of group generators\n\nbeginaligned\nZ(beta) = (ab) mid beta_(ab) = 1\nendaligned\n\ncorresponding to the nonzero entries of beta. Each Z-stabilizer generator of the quantum Tanner code is then specified by a choice of vertex v in V_0 and classical codeword beta such that the Z-stabilizer generator has support equal to the set of faces phi_v(Z(beta)). We can characterize this stabilizer generator by a binary vector x in mathbbF2^Q, where the |Q| qubits are labelled by faces of the complex. For a given Z-stabilizer generator, the restriction xQ(v) equals a basis element beta of C_0 (based on a fixed ordering of the faces), and is zero elsewhere. This yields dim(C_0)V_0 Z-type stabilizer generators, which correspond to codewords of C_0 placed locally at each vertex (Radebold et al., 2025).\n\n(Radebold et al., 2025) repeat the same process for vertices v in V_1 and basis elements of C_1 to produce dim(C_1)V_1 X-type stabilizers at each vertex of that partition.\n\nnote: Note\nWe note that there exist alternative formulations of quantum Tanner codes in the literature. The construction presented in (Radebold et al., 2025) utilizes the left-right Cayley complex structure where qubits are placed on the square faces (the 4-cycles of the form g ag gb agb) and stabilizers are defined via local tensor codes at vertices. In contrast, other approaches such as (Gu et al., Jun 2022) employ a multigraph construction where qubits are identified with edges of the multigraphs mathcalG_0^square and mathcalG_1^square derived from the left-right Cayley complex. These multigraphs have vertex set V_0 = G times 0 (respectively V_1 = G times 1). Edges correspond to squares q in Q connecting vertices (g0) and (agb0) via the relation g = agb. Stabilizers are built from Tanner codes associated with these multigraphs.\n\nStabilizer Matrices\n\nFor each vertex v ∈ V₀ and basis element β ∈ C₀, we define the support set (Radebold et al., 2025): Z(β) = {(a,b) ∈ A×B | β_(a,b) = 1}\n\nThe corresponding Z-stabilizer generator has support φv(Z(β)), where φv: A×B → Q(v) is the bijective mapping from generator pairs to incident faces (Radebold et al., 2025).\n\nSimilarly, for each vertex v ∈ V₁ and basis element β ∈ C₁, we define X-stabilizer generators with support φ_v(Z(β)) (Radebold et al., 2025).\n\nThis yields dim(C₀) × |V₀| Z-type stabilizer generators and dim(C₁) × |V₁| X-type stabilizer generators\n\nThe resulting quantum code exhibits the Low-Density Parity-Check because each stabilizer generator acts on at most Δ² qubits (where Δ = |A| = |B|) and each qubit is involved in at most 4ρ(1-ρ)Δ² stabilizer generators. These bounds remain constant as |G| → ∞, ensuring the LDPC property (Radebold et al., 2025). \n\nCSS Commutativity\n\nAll stabilizer generators of opposite type commute pairwise. The CSS orthogonality constraint  CX ⊂ CZ^⊥ is fulfilled because when a C₀-generator (from V₀) and C₁-generator (from V₁) have intersecting supports, their anchor vertices must be neighbors in the bipartite graph. If connected by a B-edge, their local views share an A-set where CA ⟂ CA^⊥ ensures orthogonality. Note that he A-edge case is analogous with CB ⟂ CB^⊥\n\nQuantum Tanner code parameters\n\nFor component codes CA[Δ, ρΔ, δΔ] and CB[Δ, (1-ρ)Δ, δΔ], the number of physical qubits is n = Δ²|G|/2, number of X-stabs is dim(C₁) × |V₁| ≈ 2ρ(1-ρ)Δ²|G| and number of Z-stabs is dim(C₀) × |V₀| ≈ 2ρ(1-ρ)Δ²|G|. The resulting quantum code rate is ≥ (2ρ - 1)². For other properties, see (Radebold et al., 2025).\n\nDihedral Ramanujan Graphs\n\nThe quantum Tanner code construction of (Radebold et al., 2025) utilizes a specific class of Frobenius groups.\n\nA finite group G is a Frobenius group if it can be expressed as a semidirect product\n\nbeginaligned\nG = N rtimes H\nendaligned\n\nwhere N (the Frobenius kernel) and H (the Frobenius complement) satisfy the condition that the ratio r = fracN-1H is a positive integer. A canonical example, and the one primarily utilized in ((Radebold et al., 2025), (Hirano et al., 2016)), is the dihedral group of order 2p for an odd prime p:\n\nbeginaligned \nD_2p = langle x y mid x^p = y^2 = 1 yxy^-1 = x^-1 rangle\nendaligned\n\nFor D_2p, the kernel is the cyclic subgroup N = langle x rangle cong mathbbZ_p and the complement is H = langle y rangle cong mathbbZ_2, yielding r = fracp-12.\n\n(Hirano et al., 2016) provides a method to construct Ramanujan graphs from these groups. A Cayley graph textCay(G S) is Ramanujan if its non-trivial eigenvalues lambda satisfy lambda leq 2sqrtS-1. For a Frobenius group G = N rtimes H with r geq 4, the Theorem 3.3 of (Hirano et al., 2016) states that the maximum \"covalency\" hatl_G mathcalS_0 for which all corresponding normal Cayley graphs remain Ramanujan is given by the trivial bound:\n\nbeginaligned \nhatl_G mathcalS_0 = l_0 = max  l in mathcalL mid l le 2(sqrtG-1) \nendaligned\n\nFor the dihedral group D_2p with p geq 11, this bound specializes to Corollary 3.4 of (Hirano et al., 2016):\n\nbeginaligned \nhatl = 2 leftlfloor sqrt2p - frac12 rightrfloor - 1\nendaligned\n\nThus, (Radebold et al., 2025) uses such dihedral groups  D_2p and their symmetric generating sets to construct the underlying expander graphs for the quantum Tanner code.\n\nExamples\n\nnote: Note\nThrough random search of classical code pairs that are used for the construction of quantum Tanner codes, we found several new instances of these codes.\n\nHere is an example of [[54, 11, 4]] quantum Tanner code from (Radebold et al., 2025):\n\njulia> using

The LPS Ramanujan graphs X^pq are p+1-regular Cayley graphs of the projective linear group mathrmPSL(2mathbbZqmathbbZ) when the Legendre symbol satisfies left( tfracpq right) = 1, and of mathrmPGL(2mathbbZqmathbbZ) when left( tfracpq right) = -1.\n\nThe construction of these graphs relies on representing the prime p as a sum of four squares. Specifically, the p+1 generators for the Cayley graph are derived from the distinct integer solutions to\n\nbeginaligned\np = a_0^2 + a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2\nendaligned\n\nwhere a_0  0 is odd and a_1 a_2 a_3 are even. That there are exactly p+1 such representations is a consequence of Jacobi’s theorem on the number of representations r_4(n):\n\nbeginaligned\nr_4(n) = 8 sum_substackd mid n  4 nmid d d\nendaligned\n\nTo generalize this construction, (Lubotzky et al., 1988) used representations by certain quaternary quadratic forms ((Dickson, 1927), (Sarnak, 1990)). Define the form\n\nbeginaligned\nmathcalQ_q(x_1 x_2 x_3 x_4) = x_1^2 + 4q^2x_2^2 + 4q^2x_3^2 + 4q^2x_4^2\nendaligned\n\nand let r_Q(n) denote the number of integer solutions v in mathbbZ^4 to mathcalQ_q(v) = n. Unlike the explicit formula for r_4(n), no simple closed form exists for r_Q(n). However, the Ramanujan conjecture (Ramanujan, 1916) proved in this context by Eichler (Eichler, 1954) and Igusa (Igusa, 1956) provides a asymptotic approximation which establishes LPS graphs X^pq as Ramanujan graphs. For n = p^k with vk ge 0v, we have\n\nbeginaligned\nr_Q(p^k) = C(p^k) + O_varepsilonleft( p^k(12 + varepsilon) right) quad textas  k to infty quad forall varepsilon  0\nendaligned\n\nwhere the main term C(p^k) is given by\n\nbeginaligned\nC(p^k) =\nbegincases\nc_1 displaystylesum_d mid p^k d  \textif  left( tfracpq right) = 1 \nc_2 displaystylesum_d mid p^k d  \textif  left( tfracpq right) = -1 text and  k \text is even \n0  textif  left( tfracpq right) = -1 text and  k text is odd\nendcases\nendaligned\n\nThe constants c_1 and c_2 are determined in Section 4 of (Lubotzky et al., 1988).\n\nnote: Note\nAs stated by (Lubotzky et al., 1988): \"As was proved in Section 3 the girth g(X^pq) of our graphs to infty as q (and hence n) to infty. Thus the spectrum of the graphs X^pq lies in  -2sqrtp 2sqrtp (besides pm(p+1)) and it is distributed in this interval according to the density dmu_p+1 as q to infty\".\n\nHere, dmu_p+1 denotes the limiting spectral distribution given in Proposition 4.3 of (Lubotzky et al., 1988) where k = p + 1 is the degree of the graph.\n\nbeginaligned\ndmu_p+1(t) = \nbegincases \ndfracsqrtp - t^24pi(p+1)(1-(t(p+1))^2)  dt  textif  t leq 2sqrtp \n0  textotherwise\nendcases\nendaligned\n\nCayley graphs of Free Groups via Geometric Group Theory\n\nAs detailed in (Lubotzky et al., 1988), for a prime p equiv 1 pmod4, there exists a set S of p + 1 integral quaternions of norm p, unique up to units and satisfying alpha equiv 1 pmod2. (Lubotzky et al., 1988) establishes that every quaternion alpha inH(\\mathbb{Z})withN(\\alpha) = p^kcan be expressed uniquely in the form\\alpha = \\varepsilon p^r Rm(\\alpha1, \\ldots, \\bar{\u0007lpha}s)where\\varepsilonis a unit2r + m = k andRmis a *reduced word* in the elements ofSand their conjugates where reduced means no generator is adjacent to its inverse (see Definition 234 of loh2017geometric(cite)) This unique factorization property shows that the multiplicative groupA(2)formed by these quaternion classes (modulo the identification\\pm p^{v1}\\alpha \\sim p^{v2}\\betais *freely generated* by the classes[\\alpha1], [\\alpha2], \\ldots, [\\alpha_s](see Proposition 235 of loh2017geometric(cite)) with every element represented by exactly one reduced word (see Corollary 236 of loh2017geometric(cite)) Consequently the Cayley graph\\text{Cay}(A(2), S)is an infinite (p + 1)-regular tree (see Theorem 231 of loh2017geometric(cite)) The finite Ramanujan graphsX^{p,q}are then constructed as explicit quotients of this tree by taking the congruence subgroupA(2q) defined as the kernel of reduction modulo2q The quotientA(2)/A(2q)is shown to be isomorphic to either\\PGL(2, \\mathbb{Z}/q\\mathbb{Z})or\\PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z}/q\\mathbb{Z}) and the resulting Cayley graph is the LPS graphX^{p,q}``.\n\nArguments\n\np: A prime number congruent to 1 pmod4.\nq: A prime number, distinct from p, also congruent to 1 pmod4.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"API/#QuantumExpanders.alternative_morgenstern_generators-Tuple{AbstractVector, AllPairs}","page":"API","title":"QuantumExpanders.alternative_morgenstern_generators","text":"Create alternative Morgenstern generators using all pairwise products (i≠j).\n\nMorgenstern showed that for every prime q, there exist infinitely many groups G_i = mathrmPGL_2(q^i) or G_i = mathrmPSL_2(q^i), each with a symmetric generating set B_i of size q+1, such that the Cayley graphs mathrmCay(G_i B_i) are Ramanujan graphs ((Morgenstern, 1994), (Dinur et al., 2022)).
